## Key Enhancements

### Advanced Analytics
* **Daily Averages:** See your average reading time per day.
* **Session Metrics:** Tracks average and median session lengths, plus pages per session.
* **Efficiency Tracking:** View your reading speed in **pages per hour (pg/hr)** and progress gain in **percentage per hour (%/hr)**.
* **Smart Totals:** Includes an "Actual Reading" metric that caps per-page time to prevent idle periods from inflating your total stats.

### Improved Interface
* **Two-Column Layout:** A redesigned stats block under the title for faster scanning.
* **High-Density Table:** Shows **7 rows per page**
* **Visual Cues:** If you've read today, the latest entry is automatically **bolded** for easy identification.

### Smarter Progress Handling
* **Flow-Aware:** Correctly calculates progress for books with "hidden flows" by deriving effective total pages.
* **Data Validation:** Filters out "junk" data—sessions are only counted if you read more than one page and spent at least 60 seconds reading.
